# Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. The game can be played by two players, one playing as X and the other playing as O. Players take turns placing their marks on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

To play the game, compile the code and run the executable. You will be prompted to select your move (row and column). If your move is invalid, you will be prompted to try again. The game will continue until one player wins or the board is full.

## Features:

1. Two-player gameplay
2. Simple and easy-to-understand code
